# Day 2 - Intro Week

## How to use this repo

Each main directory is separated into individual sections. Make sure to **read the `contents.md` file** to understand how to complete the challenges.

At each stage, run the code in the file using `node` by typing the following into the terminal:

`node path/to/correct/file.js`

Tests to check your solutions with are written for each question.

Make sure to change the `skipTest` to `runTest` before running the file in order to run the test for the current challenge.

## Top Tips

- If your test is not passing, try to read the terminal to see how your result differs from the expected one.
- `console.log` will always be useful to check your answers.
- Make sure to `return` values from your functions. The tests will not check any console logs!
