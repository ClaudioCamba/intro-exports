## How to use this repo

Each main directory is separated into individual sections.

Work through these in order, running the file name with `node` after each solution.

The tests to check your solutions with are written before each question.

Make sure to change the `skipTest` to `runTest` before running the file, in order to run the test for the current solved question.

## Top Tips

- If you test is not passing, try to read the terminal to see how your result differs from the expected.
- console.log will always be useful to check your answers.
- Make sure to `return` values from your functions. The tests will not check console logs
